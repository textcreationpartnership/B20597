            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY which it doth appear, That laying only Six Pence on a pair of Shooes, Boots, Slippers and Gloves, and Three Pence on each pair of Clogs and Galloshes, will, by a modest Compute, raise Seven hundred thirty seven Thousand five Hundred Pounds a year.</p>
            <p>For the Proof, That it will be more than a general Tax on Leather can raise, I referr it to your Consideration, Whether Shooes, Boots, Slippers, Gloves, Clogs and Galloshes, do not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the forth part of all the Leather expended in <hi>England?</hi> If so, if the Tax was but Four Pence a pair, you raise as Much as a Penny in the Pound on Leather can amount unto.</p>
            <p>Now I come to set forth, That a Tax of a Penny in the Pound on Leather in general, will be more to the poor Man, than six Pence extraordinary for a pair of Shooes.</p>

               </table>
            </p>
            <p>So that a Four Farthings Tax on Leather in general (if each Trade be as reasonable in their Demands as I am in my Compute) will be Ten Farthings a Pound, and a poor Man must pay Seven Pence Halfpenny extraordinary for a pair of Shooes, their Shooes weighing generally Three Pounds.</p>
            <p>Now if the Tax be laid on Shooes, Gloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all other Things made of Leather will be excused; as the poor Man for his Breeches, Doublets, Harness and Sadle, which will be at least Five Shillings a year extraordinary for himself only.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, <hi>That Gloves would not come to pay so high a Duty as Six Pence a pair, on a general Tax on Leather, at a Penny the Pound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I agree with you, For that Duty, they are raised more in proportion, would fall on the poor Man for Cloths and other Necessaries they use of Leather, which being laid on Gloves, will now fall on those that can better (and ought to) pay more.</p>
            <p>And yet the Rich neither pay so much from these Proposals as they would by a general Tax on Leather, considering their Coaches, Bridles, Sadles, Chairs, Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are exempted.</p>
            <p>On a Tax on Shooes, Boots, Gloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there will be a present Income from what are made; and, if laid on Leather, His Majesty will have no Advantage on what is made up, and yet His Subjects will pay the same Tax on them also.</p>
            <p>Gloves, by Act of Parliament, are prohibited; but, however, great quantities are brought over by Stealth; and if you lay a Duty on Leather, it will raise Gloves here, and more Incourage the bringing greater Quantities over: Now if laid on Gloves, they will be liable to pay, and prevent their Importation.</p>
            <p>I would have a Stamp for all Shooes, Boots, Slippers, Gloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Five Pounds Penalty on any that sell or any that buy any but what are stamped.</p>
            <p>And as the Hides must be also stamped and weighed, I leave to any to judge if this can be more char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable</p>
            <p>I am sure His Majesty cannot be so easily deceived of the Duty on Shooes and Gloves, as being liable to be discovered by the Servants of the Owners, or any other, of whose secrisie they would not for the saving six Pence, run the hazard of five Pounds: And Hides, when cut, who shall tell if they were stamped?</p>
            <p>Besides, here will be no Incroachment on the Liberty and Property of the Subject, by coming into their Houses, as must be by a general Tax on Leather.</p>
